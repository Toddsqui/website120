# Website Maker

I am not on a new campaign to make one new website each day for the next 120 days. I know that other people have done this before, but I want to try it myself and see if I can do it. For the next three months, I will make one new website skeleton each day and if anyone needs my services, I will gladly help them with their website.

My purpose for doing this is to try and make website making second-nature to me. Currently, it is not. I have to think about it. A lot. And I do it that's not mobile friendly. This has got to stop. So I am going to change my thoughts so that I can do this the right way.

Hope you join me for this adventure, in Chiang Mai Thailand.
